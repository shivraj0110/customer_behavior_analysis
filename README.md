DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT – END-TO-END ANALYSIS USING PYTHON & SQL

OVERVIEW
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data to generating insights using Python and MySQL. The project focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQL-based analysis to support data-driven decision-making.

DATASET
- Structured dataset containing business-related records.
- Includes numerical and categorical variables.
- Initially stored in CSV format and later loaded into a MySQL database.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL (MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench)
- Database Connectivity (SQLAlchemy / mysql-connector)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts

PROJECT STEPS
1. Data Loading
   - Loaded CSV data into Python using Pandas.
   - Connected Python with MySQL Server.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Analyzed data distributions and trends.
   - Identified missing values and outliers.
   - Generated summary statistics and visualizations.

3. Data Cleaning
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values.
   - Converted data types.
   - Removed duplicates.

4. SQL Analysis
   - Loaded cleaned data into MySQL tables.
   - Executed SQL queries for aggregations and filtering.
   - Derived business-focused insights.

5. Insights & Reporting
   - Interpreted analytical results.
   - Prepared insights suitable for dashboards and reports.

DASHBOARD
- Dashboards can be created using Power BI, Tableau, or Python visualizations.
- Displays KPIs, trends, and category-wise analysis.

RESULTS & KEY INSIGHTS
- Improved data quality through cleaning.
- Identified meaningful trends and patterns.
- Demonstrated effective use of Python and SQL together.

HOW TO RUN
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python libraries.
3. Update MySQL credentials in the script.
4. Run the Python notebook or script.
5. Review outputs, SQL results, and visualizations.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
- Hands-on experience with real-world data analytics.
- Strong foundation in Python EDA and SQL querying.
- Suitable for entry-level Data Analyst roles.
